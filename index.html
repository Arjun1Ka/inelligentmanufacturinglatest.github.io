        <h2>Our Project</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the official website of this work has been supported by the US Department of Education under the joint MSEIP Program with the University of Texas at El Paso, PR/Award No.: P120A220044. Our groundbreaking initiative, "Integrating Intelligent Manufacturing into Engineering Education," aims to pave the way for technical success and leadership excellence among Hispanic engineering students by fostering collaboration between the Drexel University (DU) and University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).</p>
        <p>This project brings together two geographically distant virtual teams from DU and UTEP to work on an innovative manufacturing project, focusing on cutting-edge areas of intelligent manufacturing such as machine learning, virtual reality, mobile robotics, and object manipulation. Through a dynamic research design combining both formative and summative assessment methods, we aim to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of our approach on students and faculty involved.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of Dr. Richard Chiou from DU's Department of Engineering Technology and Dr. Bill Tseng from UTEP's Department of Industrial, Manufacturing and Systems Engineering, this project aspires to revolutionize the manufacturing engineering curriculum. Both institutions are committed to embedding intelligent manufacturing concepts into their courses, thereby nurturing future leaders in the engineering field, particularly among Hispanic students.</p>

<p>Dr. Chiou and Dr. Tseng  have collaboratively developed three innovative web-based courses on intelligent manufacturing, covering key areas such as machine learning applications in manufacturing, the use of virtual reality for design and training, mobile robotics for automated systems, and advanced techniques for object manipulation. These courses are designed as senior electives and are cross-listed in both engineering curricula, ensuring a broad and impactful reach.</p>

<p>Throughout the duration of the consortium, DU and UTEP will offer a series of workshops and short courses aimed at both students and industry professionals, highlighting the practical applications and benefits of intelligent manufacturing. Our goal is to permanently incorporate these courses into the respective curricula, pending approval from the undergraduate curriculum committees by the end of 2025.</p>

<p>By focusing on intelligent manufacturing, we believe our educational initiative will:</p><br>

<ol>
  <li>Provide a sustainable and evolving educational model,</li><br>
  <li>Offer students a comprehensive understanding and hands-on experience with advanced manufacturing technologies,</li><br>
  <li>Foster a productive and enriching collaboration between DU and UTEP students, enhancing their skills and readiness for the global workforce.</li><br>
</ol>
<p>Join us in this exciting journey as we endeavor to shape the future of engineering education, driving innovation, and excellence through the power of intelligent manufacturing.</p>
